pragmatic senior software engineer / developer / polyglot.

## Open Source and sharing

- [Doctrine Extensions][doctrine_extensions] 5 years, learned how to maintain and reject new features.

- [KnpPaginatorBundle][paginator_bundle] 5 years, has grown complicated while sacrificing simplicity over easy interface.
- [dotfiles][dotfiles], [simple-terminal][st] and [statusbar][statusbar] which are my closest friends.

Frequent speaker at local conferences.

## Education

Kaunas University of Technology - Bachelor’s Degree, Informatics 2003-2008.

## Personality

Empathic, slow, reticent. Constantly learning whole life, love to read books including philosophy, novels and fiction.
I do not blindly follow the rules, but tend to question them. I always prefer composite, simple solutions or
even code duplication over sophisticated abstractions.

## Work experience

In total 10 years. Workplace details on [linkedin][linkedin].

- 3 years C++.
- 5 years PHP, javascript.
- 2 years GO.
- 1 year JAVA.
- 2 years leading teams, internal trainings.

Always worked in a team of 2 - 8 people and I'm against large teams. Skilled engineers know what needs to be done if
goals are clear. A team of skilled people, do not need to be led.
